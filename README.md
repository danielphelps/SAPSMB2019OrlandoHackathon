# SMB 2019 Orlando Hackathon 
This repository contains the winning entry for the 2019 SAP SMB Innovation 
Summit Hackathon in Orlando.  It uses a webcam to capture the user's 
reaction to items in a Business One database.  This program is adapted 
from the "cfDemoSummit18" example provided by the B1SA team.

The ui is built with create-react-app, and the python scripts use a library built on top of TensorFlow and opencv.

You can substitute the images for whatever you like in `ui/src/Items.jsx` by providing a list of dictionaries each containing a key `U_ImageURL`.

You can watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDTryd4YPoQ).

Special thanks to all the Team Reactor members and SAP Staff present during the event.

This is a sample step by step guide of how to build cloud applications based on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/). 
It is coded in [NodeJ](https://nodejs.org/en/) and also makes use of [PostGreSQL](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/dmp/capabilities/us/product/PostgreSQL-on-SAP-Cloud-Platform/) available in the [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com). 
It is integrated with [SAP Business One](https://www.sap.com/uk/products/business-one.html) using the [Service Layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaF_i7x9-s0&list=PLMdHXbewhZ2QsgYSICRQuoL8lkoEHjNzS&index=22) to list and update Items. 
The idea of this application is based in the [beer-list](https://github.com/mariantalla/beer-list) app.
